### `Summary`

This project is part of the challenge section of the "The Front-End Developer Crash Course". However, for this project, I personally challenged myself to create the application without the help of the teacher, and only watching once completed.

This project is a small page that holds a single carousel that loops around 3 images on a time interval, however the user can choose to click on the arrow to go to the next slide.

### `Languages / Techstack`

- HTML
- CSS
